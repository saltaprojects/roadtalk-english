      "description": "Hi, I'm Saltanat. While I'm not formally an English teacher, I bring a unique perspective to language learning. During my bachelor's degree, I researched teaching English using multimedia technologies, giving me valuable insights into how language learning platforms should be structured. But what really drives this project is my personal experience as a truck driver here in America. I've driven these roads, I have many truck driver friends, and I understand firsthand the challenges you face—especially when it comes to the language barrier. Most drivers don't know English well, yet we all need it to navigate this country and comply with the requirement that every truck driver must speak English. As someone who understands both the trucking world and language education, I decided to make a contribution and help solve this problem that affects so many of my fellow drivers.",
